### 3) Create a GCP bucket using Terraform
It's recommended to download a code writer like VS Code.

- Create a json file with your service account credentials.
- Create a [variables.tf](1_terraform/variables.tf) file with the key information for your bucket
- Create a [main.tf](1_terraform/main.tf) file
- On VS Code, under the main.tf run the command 'terraform init' followed by 'terraform apply'.
