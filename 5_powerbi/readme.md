## Overview Dashboard

![Dashboard](Dashboard.png)

As an initial development for this project, a dashboard was developed to allow the user to flick through the seasons and get an overview of key events like dropouts and disqualifications. 

Show ratings (where available) can also be seen overall and by week alongside the eviction of the week to see potential impacts from the loss of a contestant that had some importance to the show's narrative or a big following on social media.

Finally, the contestants evicted with highest percentages of audience votes is displayed as well as a snapshot of the mix of country states included in the season.

There are lots of further developments to be done on this dashboard.
